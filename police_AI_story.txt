Investigators arrived at the warehouse shortly after midnight, where they discovered the victim’s body outlined on the concrete floor, surrounded by a violent spray of blood. The scene showed no signs of forced entry, suggesting the attacker either had access or was familiar with the location. A heavy hammer was found discarded near the outline, its handle smeared with residue consistent with fresh impact. Early impressions indicated the weapon had been handled hastily, as though the assailant dropped it while fleeing.

Further inspection revealed a set of distinct boot prints leading away from the body and toward the storage racks. These impressions matched the size and tread pattern of footwear recently noted in the suspect’s possession during a prior stop-and-search related to warehouse trespassing. The prints showed a staggered gait, implying the suspect may have been panicked or injured during the escape. No other footprints were present, reinforcing the theory of a single assailant moving with urgency.

In a cluttered corner office, officers recovered a handgun left on a rusted workbench beside scattered financial documents. The weapon’s surface bore no fingerprints, an anomaly that drew attention to the suspect, who has a documented habit of wearing gloves during manual tasks. The documents, containing highlighted revenue discrepancies tied to the victim, appeared to provide a possible motive. Witness statements later confirmed the suspect had recently argued with the victim about these very inconsistencies.

Near the rear loading bay, a toolbox—partially opened—contained a compartment wiped noticeably clean compared with the surrounding dust. This aligned with the suspect’s known behavior of transporting tools in that model of box, often modifying compartments for concealment. With the hammer abandoned near the body, the incriminating boot prints, and the suspect’s prior access to the warehouse, the unfolding evidence painted a coherent picture: the suspect had both the opportunity and the means, and their hurried departure left behind a trail too precise to be accidental.
