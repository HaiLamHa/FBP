Investigators arrived at the warehouse shortly after midnight, finding the victim's body outlined on the concrete floor amidst a violent blood spray. The lack of forced entry suggested the attacker was familiar with the location. A heavy, residue-smeared hammer, likely the murder weapon, was found discarded nearby, indicating a hasty departure.

Crucially, a set of distinct boot prints led away from the body toward the storage racks. These prints matched the size and tread of footwear recently noted in the suspect's possession during a previous stop-and-search for trespassing. The staggered gait of the prints suggested the suspect was panicked or possibly injured during their escape, and no other footprints were found.

On a rusted workbench near the crime scene, officers recovered a handgun and financial documents detailing revenue discrepancies tied to the victim. The gun's surface was wiped clean of prints—an anomaly consistent with the suspect's documented habit of wearing gloves for manual tasks. Witness statements confirmed the suspect had recently argued with the victim over the issues highlighted in these documents, establishing a clear motive.

Near the rear loading bay, a partially opened toolbox contained a single compartment noticeably wiped clean, aligning with the suspect's known practice of using this specific model of box for tool transport and concealment. With the hammer abandoned, the incriminating boot prints, and the strong motive provided by the financial dispute, the evidence forms a coherent case: the suspect had the means, opportunity, and motive, and their hurried flight left an undeniable trail.
